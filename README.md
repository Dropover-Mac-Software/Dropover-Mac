## 🧩 Overview  

Dropover for macOS is a clever utility designed to make moving, sharing, and organizing files faster and more intuitive. With a simple shake of your cursor, you can create a temporary shelf — a floating container where you can drop files, images, links, and text snippets for easy transfer between apps or locations.  

It’s a perfect productivity companion for designers, developers, and everyday Mac users who deal with multiple files at once. Whether you’re dragging attachments into an email, uploading documents to the web, or organizing folders, Dropover eliminates the hassle of juggling multiple Finder windows.  

The app integrates seamlessly into macOS and supports drag and drop gestures system-wide. You can pin multiple shelves, rename them, and even share contents via AirDrop, Mail, or third-party cloud services. The visual design is clean and modern, fitting naturally into the macOS environment.  

Dropover also includes handy features like automatic clipboard capture, customizable appearance, and integration with automation tools such as Shortcuts. It’s lightweight, responsive, and optimized for Apple Silicon, ensuring smooth performance even on resource-heavy workflows.  

If you frequently move files between apps or folders, Dropover saves you time, reduces clutter, and adds a touch of elegance to your daily workflow.
